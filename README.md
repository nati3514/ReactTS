## Features

- **Post Creation**: Users can create new posts.
- **Comments on Posts**: Users can comment under each post.
- **Nested Comments**: Users can add comments under other comments, creating a nested structure.
- **View Existing Data**: Displays a small set of mock posts and comments to populate the page for a realistic user experience.

## Technologies Used
